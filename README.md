Development Plan

1. Flip a Coin 20 times
  - Use a loop to run the flip 20 times
2. Log how many times the coin flips "Heads" or "Tails"
  - Set the object "state" property to 0 or 1 to differentiate between heads or tails
3. Display on the webpage an image of a coin being flipped
  - Create div elements
  - Store the images to the div elements
  - Append the div elements to the body to have the images be shown on the webpage
